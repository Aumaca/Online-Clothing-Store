# About the project:
  A Online Clothing Store Web Project developed using: 
  - Django;
  - Django REST;
  - Simple JWT;
  - React.js.

## What I learned until now:
- REST APIs developing, including validation, JWT and retrieve of data;
- The JSON format;
- CORS;
- Authentication with JWT;
- To be more organized (too much lines of CSS and various React components);
- Naming Conventions for JS;
- Git;
